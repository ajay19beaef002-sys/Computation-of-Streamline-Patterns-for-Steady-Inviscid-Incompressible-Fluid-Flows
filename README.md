# Computation-of-Streamline-Patterns-for-Steady-Inviscid-Incompressible-Fluid-Flows
The aim the this project is to finding out the streamline patterns numerically  in a steady 2 dimensional inviscid incompressible flow through a chamber between inlet and outlet
# How to run the code.
1.The code is written in python.

2.File name is saved in .py format

3.The code is written using Vscode and the libray used in the code are numpy and matplotlib.

4.After running the code we get the results of streamline contour and velocity streamline and convergence histrory for different initial guess
